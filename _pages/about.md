MSc student with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the [Zurich Institute of Technology (ETHZ)](https://ethz.ch/en.html).
I have a strong passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in their applications within personalized medicine and bioinformatics. My goal is to leverage these technologies to make meaningful contributions that positively impact people's lives.
In my free time I enjoy staying active through sports such as weightlifting, running, hiking, snowboarding, and ice hockey. Additionally, I like to find time to learn random things that pick my curiosity, reading, playing videogames, and playing the guitar.
